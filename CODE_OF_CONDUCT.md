## Kuadrant Community Code of Conduct

The following document is based on the [CNCF Code of Conduct](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/main/code-of-conduct.md)

### Community Code of Conduct

As contributors, maintainers, and participants in the Kuadrant community, and in the interest of fostering
an open and welcoming community, we pledge to respect all people who participate or contribute
through reporting issues, posting feature requests, updating documentation,
submitting pull requests or patches, attending conferences or events, or engaging in other community or project activities.

We are committed to making participation in the Kuadrant community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, caste, disability, ethnicity, level of experience, family status, gender, gender identity and expression, marital status, military or veteran status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, tribe, or any other dimension of diversity.

## Our Standards

The Kuadrant Community is open, inclusive and respectful. Every member of our community has the right to have their identity respected.

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include but are not limited to:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,
  and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the
  overall community
* Using welcoming and inclusive language


Examples of unacceptable behavior include but are not limited to:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment in any form
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email
  address, without their explicit permission
* Violence, threatening violence, or encouraging others to engage in violent behavior
* Stalking or following someone without their consent
* Unwelcome physical contact
* Unwelcome sexual or romantic attention or advances
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

The following behaviors are also prohibited:
* Providing knowingly false or misleading information in connection with a Code of Conduct investigation or otherwise intentionally tampering with an investigation.
* Retaliating against a person because they reported an incident or provided information about an incident as a witness.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct.
By adopting this Code of Conduct, project maintainers commit themselves to fairly and consistently applying these principles to every aspect
of managing the Kuadrant project.
